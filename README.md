# Game to APK Converter Backend

This directory contains the backend server for the Game to APK Converter application.

## Overview

The server handles:
- File uploads
- ZIP extraction and validation
- APK building using Capacitor
- Serving APK files for download

## Running the Server

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run server
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/builds/upload` - Upload a ZIP file
- `GET /api/builds/:buildId/status` - Get build status
- `GET /api/builds/:buildId` - Get build details
- `GET /api/builds` - List all builds
- `GET /api/builds/:buildId/download` - Download the APK file

## Actual APK Building

In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Install the Android SDK
2. Install Capacitor and its dependencies
3. Configure your server with the necessary tools

For the full implementation:

1. Extract the uploaded ZIP file

6. Add the Android platform
7. Build the APK
8. Save the APK for download
